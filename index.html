                    <p>
                        Mercury the smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun is only slightly larger
                        than Earth's Moon. Its surface is covered in tens of thousands of impact craters.

                        From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when
                        viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as 11 times brighter.

                        Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system that
                        title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest
                        planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days. Mercury is appropriately named for the
                        swiftest of the ancient Roman gods.</p>

                    <p>
                        Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and Earth's closest planetary neighbor. Venus is the
                        third brightest object in the sky after the Sun and Moon. Venus spins slowly in the opposite
                        direction from most planets.Venus is similar in structure and size to Earth, and is sometimes
                        called Earth's evil twin. Its thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making
                        it the hottest planet in our solar system with surface temperatures hoenough to melt lead. Below
                        the dense, persistent clouds, the surface has volcanoes and deformed mountains.

                    <p>
                        While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our
                        solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is
                        the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.

                        Earth is the only planet in the solar system whose English name does not come from Greek or
                        Roman mythology. The name was taken from Old English and Germanic. It simply means "the ground."
                        There are, of course, many names for our planet in the thousands of languages spoken by the
                        people of the third planet from the Sun.

                    <span>Mars Facts</span>
                    <p>Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've
                        sent rovers to roam the alien landscape. NASA missions have found lots of evidence that Mars was
                        much wetter and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere, billions of years ago.

                        Mars was named by the Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was reminiscent of
                        blood. The Egyptians called it "Her Desher," meaning "the red one."

                        Even today, it is frequently called the "Red Planet" because iron minerals in the Martian dirt
                        oxidize, or rust, causing the surface to look red.

                    <p>Jupiter is a world of extremes. It's the largest planet in our solar system. If Jupiter was a
                        hollow shell, 1,000 Earths could fit inside.

                        Jupiter also is the oldest planet, forming from the dust and gases left over from the Sun's
                        formation 4.5 billion years ago. But it has the shortest day in the solar system, taking only
                        10.5 hours to spin around once on its axis.</p>

                    <p>Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.
                        Saturn is not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as
                        Saturn's. Saturn also has dozens of moons.

                        From the jets of water that spray from Saturn's moon Enceladus to the methane lakes on smoggy
                        Titan, the Saturn system is a rich source of scientific discovery and still holds many
                        mysteries.</p>

                    <span>Uranus Facts</span>
                    <p>Uranus is a very cold and windy world. The ice giant is surrounded by 13 faint rings and 28 small
                        moons. Uranus rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt
                        makes Uranus appear to spin sideways, orbiting the Sun like a rolling ball.

                        Uranus was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope. It was discovered in 1781 by
                        astronomer William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star. It
                        was two years later that the object was universally accepted as a new planet, in part because of
                        observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode.</p>

                    <p>Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is more than 30 times as far from
                        the Sun as Earth. Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye.
                        In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.

                        Neptune is so far from the Sun that high noon on the big blue planet would seem like dim
                        twilight to us. The warm light we see here on our home planet is roughly 900 times as bright as
                        sunlight on Neptune.</p>
